# 🚀 Netlify Deployment - 3 Minutes to Live!

## ⚡ FASTEST METHOD: Drag & Drop (3-5 minutes total)

### **Step 1: Build Your App (1-2 minutes)**

1. **Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)** (30 seconds)
2. **Sign up/Login** with GitHub, Google, or email (30 seconds)
3. **Drag & drop your `dist` folder** to the deploy area (10 seconds)
4. **Wait for deployment** (1-2 minutes)
5. **Your app is LIVE!** 🎉
